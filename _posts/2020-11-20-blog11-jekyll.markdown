There is a nice tool that I discovered online for development that is really helpful. In simple terms JSONPlaceholder is like a mock JSON server. For instance if I've got an app already created with no back end (server requests), I can post up some JSON data into JSONPlaceholder and make sample requests from my app. 

For me this was always helpful since I only had a cloud shared space. To post server side language in my shared space was never possible and I was required to pay for my own dedicated space. I did not want this so JSONPlaceholder was a great alternative because I could make requests to it with JavaScript.

The simple steps include the following:

1) Mock up some sample JSON data like the following:

{% highlight ruby %}
{
    firstName: "Erik",
    lastName: "Landaverde",
    age: "24",
    blogNumber: 11
}
{% endhighlight %}

2) Create a GitHub account and create a repository

3) Place your json file inside the repository and make sure to name it as db.json

4) Inside your app make an HTTP request to the URL of your json file. The format would be the following: `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>`

Hopefully you found this useful to use for your development to make instant requests to fake data.
