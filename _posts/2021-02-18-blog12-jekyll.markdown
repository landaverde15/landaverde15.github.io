This is blog 1 of Spring semester course CIT481. I have not really done anything technical this week so I decided to dedicate this blog toward the idea for the group project and the tech stack we will be using.

I came out with the project idea of creating an application that renders top performing stocks and crypto currencies. How did I come out with this idea? Well because there is no better time than now to invest in stocks and crypto amidst the scandal with GameStop stock and Doge Coin. 

The tech stack we will be using for this application is the following:

=====> Front End
       - Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS

=====> Back End
       - JavaScript AJAX requests to retrieve data

=====> API 
       - RapidAPI = a tool that contains thousands of API's for different types of data

For the project stack we decided to keep it simple. We didn't want to make it too complex that we don't have a working application to present at the end of the semester. If time permits and the group shows improvement throughout the weeks we will possibly build a simple back end in GoLang to handle the API requests and create an improved slick front end using ReactJS.

Thank you,
