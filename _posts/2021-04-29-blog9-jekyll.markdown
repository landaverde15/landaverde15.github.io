This week I decided to write about a cool tool that I use for web development. When it comes to CSS, it is recommended to have useful tools to make styling to your application/website a walk in the park. The tool "HTML Color Codes" - `https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/`, is mainly used for picking colors. Sometimes in web development a designer might use colors that are either formatted in: Hex numbers, RGB, or HSL. For example

Hex numbers look like: `#6293C7`
RGB look like: `98, 147, 199`
HSL look like: `211, 51%, 58%` 

These would all go in css just as: 
`background-color: #6293C7`
`background-color: rgb(98, 147, 199)`
`background-color: hsl(211, 51%, 58%)`

When you're navigating in this page you can choose all color types from a grid and you can scroll to any shade you want. Then automatically your color codes are generated. 

Usually when your code editor does not have a color picker tool, this tool would be a great one to reference. Simply bookmark this onto your browser and use it when needed!
