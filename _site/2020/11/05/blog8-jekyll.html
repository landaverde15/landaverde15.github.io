    <p>Hello everyone! For this week’s blog post I will touch a little on AWS CLI. This week’s Lab was about setting up an EC2 instance and running an Apache server on it and rendering a custom HTML page. I have to say I really enjoyed this lab. It surprised me because networking is not my area of interest. To be quite honest I find it a bit boring. My area of interest in the computer science realm is software development. Anyway, after completing this lab it was really surprising to me that I had actually set up an EC2 instance in the cloud and I connected to it via my local laptop through the command prompt. That amazed me. Now, I will get into how I interacted with my EC2 instance that is in the cloud via my local laptop using the AWS CLI.</p>

<p>===&gt; What is AWS CLI?
I think it is important to first go over what is the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). AWS CLI is a tool to manage your AWS services. By downloading the AWS CLI you can configure and control multiple services from your command line. The steps would look something like:
————————————————————————————
<strong>Run command</strong>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -i "cit480.pem" ec2-user@ec0-0-000-000-00.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com</code>
<strong>Explanation</strong>:
-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cit480.pem</code> = your private key
-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ec2-user</code> = user in instance
-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ec0-0-000-000-00.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com</code> = Your public IPV4 DNS
-You may be prompted some questions after running the above command so answer
accordingly
————————————————————————————</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Run command</strong>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo yum install aws cli</code> 
<strong>Explanation</strong>:
-Depending on your linux distro for your instance you would install the AWS CLI. The     above command works for a CentOS Linux distro instance
————————————————————————————</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Run command</strong>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws --version</code>
<strong>Explanation</strong>:
-This is to check that the AWS CLI was successfully installed
————————————————————————————</p>

<p>From here on out you can access all your AWS services. For Lab 4 we had to make some configurations to our S3 buckets. I did this by running the following command:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name"</code>
The following is the actual response I get from my instance:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s2">"cit480"</span>
<span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With AWS CLI you can manage literally everything. Since I’ve only consumed EC2 + S3 services, those are the only commands I know. In a future blog post I will get into other services.</p>

<p>Hack on!</p>
